Hey there! 👋
I’m Lekan, a backend-focused developer based in Nigeria.

I build practical, scalable systems with a strong focus on Python and Django — my favorite tools in my stack. If there’s a problem that can be solved with clean logic and a solid backend, I’m probably interested in building it.

My main tech stack includes Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Heroku, and I enjoy turning ideas into working systems that actually make sense in the real world.

I’ve worked on several projects, but my favorite so far is an Inventory Management System, where I focused on data modeling, CRUD operations, and admin-side efficiency.

I enjoy learning by building — breaking things, fixing them, and improving the structure each time.

Fun facts about me:

* I work out regularly 💪
* I can sew 🧵
* I can play the piano 🎹
* I enjoy building things, both in code and outside of it
